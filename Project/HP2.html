            <p>Harry Potter is about to start his second year at Hogwarts. Harry expects it to be a normal year after his experiences the term before but a secret chamber opens, muggle-born students are attacked and Harry must put his life in danger once more.

                    The three main characters in the story are Harry Potter – a young wizard who finds out he can speak Parselmouth (talk to snakes) and is mistaken for the heir of Slytherin; Ron Weasley – Harry’s best friend who steals his Father’s flying car 
                    to fly himself and Harry to Hogwarts; and Hermione Granger – Harry’s other best friend who is the smartest student in their year at school but who is petrified when the attacks start. The new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher is Gilderoy Lockhart who is a self-obsessed lunatic of a teacher.
                    I enjoyed this book because it is packed with action, fantasy and creativity. My favourite part is when Harry is pulled into Riddle’s diary and is made to witness the expulsion of his friend Hagrid when he was at Hogwarts 50 years before.

                    There are not many people who haven’t read this series but I would recommend this to anyone who loves fantastical stories and it is definitely worth 5 stars.
